   Installing Prettier and ESLint in your IDE can help automate this!

Any AI used to make changes to the project must be disclosed in the pull request.

Automated changes and pull requests (e.g. OpenClaw) is disallowed.

Maintainers hold the right to close pull requests and deny changes that are suspected of using automated AI tools, or where the developer cannot explain what the changes contain.

## Maintainer Rights

The maintainer(s) holds the right to do the following:

- Request / push changes to a pull request before it is merged
- Reject pull requests that are low-quality, automated or do not align with the project's goals
